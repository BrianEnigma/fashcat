# The List of Trump’s Forbidden Words That Will Get Your Paper Flagged at NSF

## It's fascism, plain and simple.

Every federal agency in the U.S. is currently trying to figure out how to
purge forbidden words from documents posted online, in a desperate attempt
to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to purge “DEI” from
every facet of American life. And nowhere is that effort more bizarre than
the National Science Foundation, which is currently combing through
websites and research papers for a long list of words that include
“female,” “disability,” and “LGBT,” among a host of others.

The review comes in response to a memo sent out Jan. 29 from the Office of
Personnel Management, written by acting director Charles Ezell. Every
agency has interpreted the memo a little differently, but at NSF they’ve
compiled a list of words that need to be found which will initiate a review
to see if it’s allowed.

According to the Washington Post, a word like “women” appearing will get
the content flagged, but it will need to be manually reviewed to determine
if the context of the word is related to a forbidden topic under the
anti-DEI order. Trump and his fellow fascists use terms like DEI to
describe anything they don’t like, which means that the word “women” is on
the forbidden list while “men” doesn’t initiate a review.

Straight white men are seen through the MAGA worldview as the default human
and thus wouldn’t be suspicious and in need of a review. Any other type of
identity is inherently suspect.

Some of the terms that are getting flagged are particularly eyebrow-raising
in light of the Nazi salutes that Trump supporters have been giving since
he took office. For example, the term “hate speech” will get a paper at NSF
flagged for further review. Redefining terms like “hate speech” is
obviously part of the fascist project.

Darby Saxbe, a professor at the University of Southern California tweeted
the list of banned words on Monday., including a decision tree she says had
been sent to all program officers at NSF.

Again, this isn’t just happening at NSF. As Gizmodo reported last week, CDC
is also purging its websites and reports of forbidden words.

All of this is happening while billionaire Elon Musk, an unelected
representative of Trump’s government, is ransacking his way through the
federal bureaucracy, gaining access to highly sensitive data with basically
no one to stop him.

It’s still not clear what happens on the other side of all this. But when
they’re flagging words like “women” and “trauma,” less than three weeks in,
it can’t be good.
